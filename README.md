Start by creating a new project folder in VS Code, and inside that project folder, create two empty new files: index.html and indexes6.js. The index.html file contains the HTML code. In this project, we are also using Bootstrap.
Bootstrap is used for applying styling the user interface components. The easiest way to include Bootstrap is to add it from https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/.
Bootstrap also provides us many components that can be used to provide good user experience and user interactions in a web page like cards, navigation bars, dropdowns, icons, buttons, forms and also sizing options for different DOM elements
